/**
 * Shared type-identity primitives for the wavefront query pack.
 *
 * C gives an aggregate a name in two places, and CodeQL surfaces only
 * one of them on the `UserType` itself:
 *
 *   struct tag { ... };                    -> getName() = "tag"
 *   typedef struct { ... } T;              -> getName() = "(unnamed class/struct/union)"
 *
 * The second spelling is not rare in OpenSSL -- `PACKET`, `OSSL_TIME`,
 * `CLIENTHELLO_MSG`, the `OSSL_HPKE_*` family -- and `(unnamed ...)` is a
 * plausible-looking non-empty string, so a query that keys on `getName()`
 * collapses every such type into one bucket instead of failing loudly.
 *
 * Two DIFFERENT resolutions apply, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   shape A   typedef struct { int x; } T;          identity = the typedef name
 *             `t.x`                                 found SIDEWAYS, via the alias chain
 *
 *   shape B   struct N { struct { int x; } inner; }; identity = the enclosing named
 *             `n.inner.x`                            struct, found OUTWARD via the
 *                                                    qualifier chain (see
 *                                                    `edges/fa_with_root.ql`)
 *
 * This module owns shape A and the primitives both shapes need. Shape B
 * stays in `fa_with_root.ql`, which is where the qualifier expression is in
 * scope. A query that must handle both composes them -- see
 * `edges/field_accesses.ql`.
 *
 * Deliberately primitives, NOT policy: `edges/casts.ql` drops anonymous tags
 * outright and `edges/field_type_uses.ql` attributes shape B to the owning
 * root under a qualified member path. Those divergences are intentional, so
 * this module exposes the building blocks and lets each query choose.
