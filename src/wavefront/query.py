    ``t2/fa_with_root``     the outermost NAMED container plus a dotted member

                            ``ssl_session_st`` narrows to 32 of its 41 fields,
                            losing the whole ``ext.*`` group.

    ``t2/field_accesses``   the IMMEDIATE declaring type. The only edge that
                            names a by-value-embedded struct: ``s->ts_msg_read.t``
                            is `ssl_connection_st`/`ts_msg_read.t` to the walk

                            container a projecting getter and the embedded type
                            its own field accessor.

    Taking either alone loses the other's case; ``fa_with_root`` is not a
    superset of ``field_accesses``, which is the trap this docstring exists to
    stop someone (me, twice) falling into.

    on the bare name. `field_accesses.csv` gives both halves — ``enclosing_name``
    is the accessing function and ``access_file`` is the file the access
    expression sits in, which for a body access IS that function's defining file
    — and without the second half two same-named file-local statics collapse
    into one entry that names a function the caller then cannot find. The type
    side of the row was already keyed this way (``struct_def_file``); this is the
    other end of the same edge.

    `is_dropper` and `is_disposer` are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE -- the arg's storage is

    the allocation is gone) and a cleanup that resets the fields in place is
    `is_disposer` alone. A block that asserts NO role is rejected: submit `null`.

      - `is_disposer` => EITHER (a full dtor owns it; a `*_cleanup` borrows it).
    An arg whose `ptr` is still `null` (unanalyzed) is exempt from these — the
    ownership fact does not exist yet to contradict.
