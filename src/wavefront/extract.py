"""extraction — the one composer stage with side effects.

Runs the T1 (entities) + T2 (edges) `.ql` batches against the CodeQL database
below the config's explicit `state_dir` and writes one CSV per query under its
`codeql/{t1,t2}/`. Every other artifact derives from those tables on
demand: scope and the dag through :mod:`wavefront.cache`, the type and
symbol records through :mod:`wavefront.manifests`.

The database itself is not produced here — configuring the project, building it
under `codeql database create --language=cpp --command=...`, and depositing the
result is done by hand.
