"""cache.py — fingerprinted on-disk caches for the composed artifacts.

The dependency graph is a pure function of the explicitly selected
`wavefront-config.json` and the CodeQL tables. It is cached privately under
`<state_dir>/.cache/configs/<config-sha256>/`; the in-memory inventory is
never persisted.

`_VERSION` is the composer's contribution to the fingerprint: bump it when a
composer changes what it emits from unchanged inputs.

#: Bump when a composer's OUTPUT changes for unchanged inputs.
#:  1 — pair-keyed type nodes; `deps.types` carries `defined_in`.
#:  3 — `wrap.anchors`; anonymous tags dropped from `wrap.types`.
#:  4 — dag keeps every field of an anchor-DEFINED wrap struct.
#:  5 — anchored `declared_in` falls back to one canonical header, not all.
#:  6 — sections renamed port/wrap -> target/import; anchors removed.
#:  7 — authored config split into impl_files/api_headers;
#:      sections renamed target/import -> targeted/imported.
#:  8 — scope is objective-independent: `targeted` is impl+api on both
#:      campaigns, `imported` is always the external closure, and the new
#:      `api` view carries the declaration-anchored public surface. The
#:      seeded import walk and `imported.seeds` are gone.
