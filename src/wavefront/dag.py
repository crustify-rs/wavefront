"""Dependency-graph model and shared readers.

The graph is deterministically composed from C facts and stored only in a
fingerprinted private cache. Scheduling and ``query dag`` share this node model,
type metadata, and canonical lifecycle-operation ordering.

The ordering in particular is shared ON PURPOSE — :func:`ordered_ops` is the one
definition both the scheduler and ``query types --lifecycle-ops`` consume, so the two
never disagree on a type's op set or its order.
