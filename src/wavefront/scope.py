"""scope.py — the per-target scope manifest, composed in memory.

`in-memory inventory` is a pure function of the explicit, hand-authored
`wavefront-config.json` and the CodeQL T1/T2 tables. Every stage reads the
selected config off disk, which once made it the one
artifact whose staleness a human could cause directly: edit `wavefront-config.json`,
forget `analyze scope`, and wrap/query/dag all run against the previous port
set without a word. That is exactly the failure `dag.build` removed for the
graph, and the same fix applies — compose it, don't cache it.

Two halves, both composer-only:

  ``targeted``  from `wavefront-config.json` + T1, ~0.12s
  ``imported``  the closure of ``targeted`` over T1/T2, ~1.4s (dominated by
                parsing `macro_expansions.csv` and friends)

Plus a cross-cutting ``api`` view: what ``api_headers`` PUBLISHES, selected on
declaration sites. Not a section — it overlaps both.

The inventory is objective-neutral. Graph depth is an explicit scheduling or
query option.

:func:`build` memoizes per `(repo_root, target)` for the life of the process,
which is what makes the multi-read commands cheap: `deps_dag.compose` alone
wants it twice, and `query` up to six times.

Nothing writes this inventory to disk.
