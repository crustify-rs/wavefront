"""manifests.py — the type / symbol records, composed on demand.

The composer emits the structural half from the CodeQL tables; the authored
half comes from `ownership-store.json` (:mod:`wavefront.store`). A consumer sees
the whole record.

Composing costs 1.7s for types and 2.2s for symbols, and narrowing does not
reduce it: the work is parsing the T1/T2 tables and building the indexes, not
the per-entry emit. Memoized per `(repo_root, target, kind)` for the process.
