"""store.py — `ownership-store.json`, the authored half of the analysis.

Holds only what no composer can infer: ownership (`ptr`), lifecycle
(`lifetime`), refcount and locking bindings, the agent's notes, and enough to
key each record. A field's `type` / `ref` / `array`, an argument's `position` /
`const` / `depth`, `kind`, `declared_in`, footprints and `casted` are composed
on demand and merged in at read time by :mod:`wavefront.manifests`, so a
consumer sees a whole record.

    types[]    name, defined_in                    <- key
               _comment_agent?
               fields[]  name                      <- key
                         ptr? refcount? locked_by? _comment_agent?

    symbols[]  name, defined_in, variant?          <- key
               lifetime? forks? callsites? _comment_agent?
               ptr_args[]  name                    <- key
                           ptr
               ptr_ret?    ptr

A pointer argument keys on `name`, not `position`: a signature edit shifts
positions and would re-attach an ownership block to the wrong argument.

Repo-tier: an ownership judgement is a fact about the C, not about which
target is building.
