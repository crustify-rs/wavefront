"""Scope classification — the load-bearing composer every other
composer imports.

The classification rule is definition-anchored:

  An entity is TARGETED iff EITHER:
    1. (Primary path) It has a definition in the CodeQL database AND
       that definition's file is in `in-memory inventory`'s `targeted.files`, OR
    2. (Fallback for entities with no definition in the DB) It has
       no definition in the database AND all its declarations live
       in target files.

  Otherwise the entity is IMPORTED — reached, not named.

For typedefs an additional rule applies: a typedef inherits the
scope of its terminal underlying user type, walking the `aliases`
chain emitted by `entities/types.ql`. This avoids the typedef ↔
struct scope-split that would otherwise classify e.g.
`SSL_CONNECTION` (typedef in a target header) and `ssl_connection_st`
(struct in a reached header) on opposite sides of the boundary even
though they represent the same conceptual type.

This module exports the rule as a single classifier function plus
a typedef-resolution helper. Higher-level orchestration —
loading the T1 CSVs, building the type index, producing per-section
splits — happens in the manifest composers (`types_manifest.py`,
`syms_manifest.py`, etc.) that import from here.
