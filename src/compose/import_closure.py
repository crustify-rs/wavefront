"""Compute the IMPORTED surface for a target (in-memory inventory `imported`).

Tier (iii): a pure function of CodeQL facts + the target seed. The surface is
computed DIRECTLY from the T1 entity tables + the T2 reach graph — it does NOT
read ``syms.json`` (or ``types.json``), so ``in-memory inventory`` is a standalone
pre-analysis artifact, independent of whether ``analyze symbols``/``types`` has
run. (``build_index`` recomputes the exact per-symbol ``depends_on`` view the
symbols composer would write, sharing ``syms_manifest``'s reach primitives, so
the result is byte-equivalent to the old post-``analyze symbols`` aggregation.)
The per-target derivation:

  1. Walk the targeted entities (those whose home is a ``in-memory inventory``
     ``targeted.files`` entry) and follow their ``depends_on`` edges into the
     items they use.
  2. Keep the deps that fall OUTSIDE the targeted set — the FFI frontier.
  3. **Narrow** each item's ``declared_in`` — which is the entity-table
     *superset* of every declaration site — down to the header(s) the importing
     target TU actually ``#include``s, using the build-resolved include graph
     (``includes.csv``). A header H survives iff it declares the item **and** is
     in the transitive include-closure of the target TU that depends on it.

The result is the precise import surface (not the all-decls superset, not the
implicit not-targeted complement), persisted as the ``imported`` section of
the target's in-memory inventory — **derived and regenerable** from ``targeted``
(recompute
when it changes). An item that survives through >1 distinct header is genuinely
imported two ways: a re-export signal, recorded rather than collapsed.

Membership says only that the campaign does not OWN the item. Ownership is
objective-independent: both `port` and `wrap` campaigns own the entities homed
in `impl_files` + `api_headers`, and this section is their derived external
frontier. What a wrap campaign publishes and schedules is the separate `api`
view. What will be DONE with an item — a safe wrapper over the seam, or a native
translation — is the translate stage's per-wave `--objective`, chosen by the
orchestrator.

    ``reexport`` flag when an item is imported through more than one header.

    Two complementary walks out of the TARGETED section:

      - **symbols** — expand each target symbol's ``depends_on`` edges (the
        callable surface plus the types its signature and body name),
        classifying each as an import (the FFI frontier) or as target (keep

      - **types** — walk the CodeQL field-type graph (``type_rows`` = T1
        ``types``, ``field_type_rows`` = T2 ``field_type_uses``). A TARGETED
        struct is full-scanned: it is the target's own layout, so every field

    There is one walk, always: the targeted section is never empty (it is
    `impl_files` ∪ `api_headers`), so the
    imported section is always its DERIVED closure — the external frontier.
    The alternative seeded walk this function used to carry, for a wrap
    campaign whose targeted section composed empty, is retired: the public
    surface is now the cross-cutting `api` view, selected on declaration sites
    by `scope_manifest._api_entities`, and a wrap campaign schedules on that
    rather than on a section that had to pretend the library was foreign to
    itself.

    Nothing here decides what will be DONE with an item; that is the campaign
    objective and the per-wave `--objective`. An import is simply something
    the campaign does not own.
