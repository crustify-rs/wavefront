"""deps_dag.py — unified dependency DAG over types AND symbols.

Builds one scope-agnostic directed graph whose
nodes are **types** and **all symbols** (functions / macros / globals,
including a type's lifecycle methods), where ``A -> B`` means "A needs B
emitted first". Topo-sorted (Tarjan SCC → longest-path layers), it drives
``wavefront schedule`` and ``query dag``.

Relationships come straight from the analysis tree:

  - **type → type**   non-scalar ``fields[].type`` (struct layout) PLUS a
                      **cast-centrality** edge from ``casted.{to,from}``: an
                      ``X -> T`` for each ``T in X.casted.to`` that is strictly
                      more cast-central (cast to/from more types) than ``X``.
                      High degree marks the hub — a generic engine erased to by
                      many instances, or a polymorphic base downcast to by many
                      derived — so the edge runs low-degree (instance/derived)
                      UP to the high-degree engine/base it depends on, never the
                      reverse. Strict ``>`` keeps it acyclic (low→high only), so
                      the ambiguous bidirectional cast relation resolves to a
                      correct-direction ordering edge without manufacturing an
                      SCC.
  - **symbol → type / symbol**  every emitted symbol carries a codebase-wide
                      ``depends_on`` (the composer applies no port/wrap shape
                      fork); ``ptr_args``/``ptr_ret`` types fold in as the
                      fallback for symbols without one.

**Callbacks are symbols, not types.** A function-pointer typedef is a
signature — it carries ``ptr_args``/``ptr_ret``, not ``fields[]`` — so it mints
an ordinary ``SymNode`` keyed ``(name, canonical-decl)`` like any other
declaration-only symbol, and gets no special handling here: consumers reach it
through their own ``depends_on.syms``, exactly as they reach a direct callee.
The composer (``syms_manifest._callback_deps``) puts it there, from both the
signature relation and the indirect-call relation. The one place a callback is
still resolved by name is a struct FIELD of function-pointer type, which the
type-side ``fields[].type`` string cannot route on its own (see ``cb_keys``).

**Ops are NOT folded into their types.** Every op (ctor/dtor/up_ref/clone/
locking/method) is its own symbol node; its dependency on its type falls out
of the op's signature (the receiver / return type). Folding ops would inherit
their *body*-level deps onto the type and project the dense function-call
graph onto the types, manufacturing huge artificial SCCs (e.g. the libgit2
ODB/pack subsystem collapsed into one 82-node cycle). Unfolded, the type
graph is acyclic (only field edges) and only genuine recursion remains as
SCCs.

**No lifecycle is stored here at all** — not the op list, not their signature
types. A type's method surface is reverse-derived from the acting symbols'
``lifetime``, an LLM-submitted judgement field. Folding op signatures into a
type's deps made the LAYERING a function of agent output (one dropper
declaration moved 1,021 nodes by a layer), and merely *listing* the ops made the
FILE one. The graph is a pure function of the C —
field types, signature types, ``depends_on`` and the cast graph, every one
composer-derived from CodeQL — so the same tree always yields the same bytes.
The wrap scheduler still co-emits a type with its methods; it reverse-derives
them from the analysis tree at schedule time (``_schedule.load_type_meta`` ->
``ordered_ops``), which also means a submission takes effect on the next wave
with no recompose in between.

Nothing is dropped: external/libc symbols and builtins referenced by
``depends_on.syms`` become symbol nodes too (subkind ``external`` /
``builtin``) so the topo order is complete. The builtin→Rust lowering table
is deferred — builtins are only *tagged* here.

Scope (targeted/imported) is NOT stored — it is derived by the orchestrators
from ``in-memory inventory`` at schedule time. Read-only, deterministic, no CodeQL.

    ``depends_on`` it gained then. Building this target's graph from that
    unfiltered tree imports another target's body edges, which deepens the
    layering for work this target never does.

    So edges are narrowed per node against THIS target's scope:

      - **targeted symbol** — every edge. Its body is translated, so its
        callees and field-derived type uses are real dependencies.
      - **imported symbol** — signature only. A binding is emitted from the
        signature alone: callee edges are dropped outright, and type edges
        keep only signature/opaque uses (``fields: []``).
      - **imported struct** — only fields the targeted scope actually touches
        (``port_fields``); the rest of the layout is never reached through
        this target and must not order its work. EXCEPT when its definition
        sits in a selected layout file — a targeted file, or an
        ``api_headers`` definition — where the layout IS the API and
        every field edge is kept.

    Under ``api_headers_only`` ``port_syms`` is empty, so EVERY symbol
    takes the signature-only path and every struct outside ``layout_paths``
    (there, ``api_headers``) orders no field work at all: exactly how an
    imported item behaves on a port campaign, which is the point. Scope is
    unchanged either way — the library is still TARGETED, it is just read
    shallowly. The default graph is body-deep.
