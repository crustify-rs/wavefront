"""Compose the symbol records, grouped by source stem.

Each stem group lists every symbol (function, macro, global, or callback — a
function-pointer typedef) defined or declared in its file(s).

**Scope gates EMISSION, never CONTENT.** Which records are emitted (and
how they're tagged / post-filtered by `--targeted-only` / `--imported-only`) is a
scope decision; every record that IS emitted carries its full
codebase-wide composition. This mirrors the type manifest, whose
`opaque_in` / `non_opaque_in` footprints are COMPLETE for port AND wrap.

One entry shape:

  - **Base**: name, kind, declared_in, defined_in, type, ptr_args,
    ptr_ret.
  - **Plus, for every emitted record**: macros add `used_by` (call
    sites); functions add `used_by` (call + ref reach) and
    `depends_on` (flat `syms` list with `{name, defined_in,
    declared_in}` records + `[{type, fields: []}]` types list);
    globals add `used_by` (accessors). Macro `body` is never emitted —
    the agent reads the expansion from source.

The reach relations are scope-agnostic raw lookups and the
field-access index is repo-wide, so full composition costs a few dict
hits per record; the total stays bounded by what scope admits.

A **callback** is signature-shaped and fully built by the composer
regardless of scope (CodeQL identifies it deterministically — a
typedef whose unwrap chain reaches a `RoutineType`): it carries
`ptr_args`/`ptr_ret`, `used_by.{call,ref}`, and a signature
`depends_on`, with `defined_in: null`. The agent fills only its
per-arg/return ownership.

Per-source-file partitioning rule lives in `path_partition.py`.
The merge primitive (`manifest_merge.merge_manifest_file`) handles
cross-target evolution via field-level union — a wrap entry that
gains target-section additions in a later target invocation gets the new
fields added without overwriting any composer-filled or
agent-annotated fields already present.

Wrap-side kind exclusion: `function_static`, `function_inline_tu`,
and `global_static` are TU-bounded and cannot appear in wrap output;
the composer filters them when emitting wrap entries.

      - **Scope.json + seed mode** (`scope_json_path` set AND any
        of `dirs`/`files`/`names` set): entries matching the seed
        predicate become seeds. From target seeds, the composer
        computes a one-hop forward closure and adds touched symbols
        to the output. **Seed admission gate**: an import seed
        is admitted only if it is reachable from target code per
        the in-memory inventory. Port-scope seeds emit with port additions;
        wrap seeds + closure emit as base shape.
      - **Scope.json + filter mode** (`scope_json_path` set, no
        seed flags): emit every reachable entry. Port-scope entries
        emit with port additions; import entries emit as base.
