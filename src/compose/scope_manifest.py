"""Compose objective-neutral target inventory from ``wavefront-config.json``.

`wavefront-config.json` names TWO file sets, always, whatever the campaign:

  `impl_files`   the sources (and private headers) that IMPLEMENT the library
  `api_headers`  the headers that PUBLISH its API

`targeted` is `impl_files` ∪ `api_headers`, `imported` is its derived external
closure, and the `api` view is what `api_headers` declares.

Rules:

  1. A file is a *candidate* if `impl_files` or `api_headers` names it —
     directly, or through a trailing-slash directory entry that expands to
     every C/C++ source or header (`.c`, `.cc`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`)
     beneath it.
  2. A candidate survives iff its repo-root-relative path does not match
     any entry in `config.out_of_scope.paths` (entries ending with `/`
     match recursively; otherwise exact-file match).
  3. Everything an in-scope entity REACHES but that neither key names is
     imported, derived by `import_closure.py` into the sibling `imported`
     section — the campaign's EXTERNAL dependencies.

Alongside them, the `api` view: what `api_headers` PUBLISHES, selected on
DECLARATION sites. Not a section — it overlaps both, because publication and
ownership are independent questions.

Inventory shape:

      * a **file** — ``include/internal/statem.h``

    whatever a directory entry expands to. Directory entries are what make
    "this whole subtree **plus** these specific headers" expressible: a
    port cluster often spans a tree it does not own, because the structs
    its code implements are declared in headers that live elsewhere.
