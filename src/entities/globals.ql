/**
 * Enumerate every global variable in the database.
 *
 * Returns one row per `GlobalVariable`, regardless of whether the
 * defining initializer is in the database. Declaration-only
 * `extern` globals (declared in a header but defined in a TU outside
 * the DB) appear with `def_file = ""` — consumers must distinguish
 * them from globals whose definition is in the DB.
 *
 * Linkage class is derived from the variable's properties:
 *   - "global_static"   — file-local linkage (declared `static`)
 *   - "global_extern"   — externally linkable (the default)
 *
 * # cols:
 *   name        : the variable's C identifier
 *   linkage     : "global_static" | "global_extern"
 *   type        : the variable's declared C type as a single string,
 *                 including const-qualifiers and array dimensions
 *                 (e.g. `const unsigned char tls11downgrade[8]`)
 *   def_file    : repository-relative path of the definition's file,
 *                 or "" if no definition is in the DB
 *   decl_files  : pipe-separated list of repository-relative paths
 *                 of all declaration entries (typically the headers
 *                 carrying the `extern` declaration); may be empty
 *
 * No `hasDefinition()` filter at the outer level — consumers need
 * declaration-only externs to identify boundary-crossing globals.
 * The def_file "" sentinel surfaces the missing-definition case
 * explicitly. This is the same rule as functions.ql; see
 * PITFALLS.md §2026-05-31.
 *
 * Function-local variables and parameters are NOT enumerated here —
 * they are intra-function noise and never cross the wrap/port
 * boundary. The query filters to `GlobalVariable`, which excludes
 * `LocalVariable` and `Parameter` by class.
