/**
 * Enumerate every user-defined type referenced from a struct/union
 * field's declared type.
 *
 * One row per (struct, field, user_type) triple. The pattern is
 * the field-level analogue of `edges/signature_type_uses.ql` — for
 * each field of every named struct or union, walk the field's type
 * (unwrapping pointers, arrays, qualifiers, and typedef aliases)
 * and emit a row for each user-defined type reached.
 *
 * Why this exists: the type-manifest composer needs to know which
 * user types a port-touched field exposes. Example: port code does
 * `s->session->cipher` — the `cipher` field of `ssl_session_st` has
 * type `SSL_CIPHER *`. To make the binding work on the Rust side,
 * `SSL_CIPHER` must appear in `wrap/types.json` (at least as an
 * opaque handle), even if no port-fn signature or body ever names
 * `SSL_CIPHER` directly. The composer joins this query against the
 * port-side `field_accesses` rows to discover such transitively-
 * reachable types.
 *
 * Both the typedef alias and its underlying user-type at every
 * chain step are emitted as separate rows (same convention as
 * signature_type_uses.ql) — consumers reconcile via the type-index
 * typedef walk.
 *
 * # cols:
 *   struct_name      : C tag of the declaring struct/union
 *   struct_def_file  : repository-relative path of the declaring
 *                      struct's definition site, or "" if no
 *                      full-body definition is in the DB
 *   field_name       : the field's C identifier
 *   type_name        : the user-defined type's C tag (struct tag,
 *                      typedef name, etc. — whatever cpp-all
 *                      surfaces at the chain step)
 *   type_kind        : "struct" | "union" | "enum" | "typedef"
 *   type_def_file    : repository-relative path of the type's
 *                      definition site, or "" if no full-body
 *                      definition is in the DB
 *
 * Consumer: `src/compose/types_manifest.py` —
 * field-driven reachability gate (scenarios 5+6 in the reach
 * ruleset, per the design discussion).
 *
 * Identity on BOTH ends comes from `identity.qll`'s `canonicalTypeName`, the
 * same resolver `field_accesses.ql` / `fa_with_root.ql` use. An aggregate with
 * no tag of its own is named by its typedef (shape A) or by the named struct
 * that embeds it (shape B); only a genuinely unresolvable one is skipped.
 * Sharing the resolver is the point -- this query kept its own naming when the
 * access queries were fixed, and silently dropped every field-type edge of a
 * `typedef struct {…} T;`.
