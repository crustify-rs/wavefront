/**
 * Enumerate every non-call use of a function identifier.
 *
 * One row per `FunctionAccess` that is NOT the callee of a `Call`.
 * This captures the patterns that produce `called_by.ref` entries
 * for functions:
 *
 *   - Explicit address-of: `&foo`
 *   - Callback storage: `cb->handler = foo;`
 *   - Function-pointer initializer entries: `{ .ops = foo, ... }`
 *   - Bare identifier in a non-call context (rare; usually implicit
 *     decay to function pointer)
 *
 * Calls themselves are excluded — they belong to
 * edges/function_calls.ql. Querying both and unioning would
 * double-count the call site (a `Call(foo, args)` contains a
 * `FunctionAccess` for `foo` as its callee expression).
 *
 * # cols:
 *   enclosing_name      : the enclosing function's C identifier; for a
 *                         file-scope access (a static initializer table) the
 *                         VARIABLE being initialised; "" if neither
 *   access_file         : repository-relative path of the access
 *                         site's file
 *   target_name         : the referenced function's C identifier
 *   target_def_file     : repository-relative path of the target's
 *                         definition site, or "" if no definition is
 *                         in the DB
 *   access_line         : 1-indexed line number of the access site
