# Symbol record schema

Field **meaning** for a symbol record — the properties the deterministic
symbols composer infers, and the ownership judgements an agent submits. The
exact JSON shape of a submission, and its validation rules, are the *contract*,
served separately by `wavefront <repo> <target> query symbols
--update-help`, so meaning and shape never duplicate.

One record per symbol: a function, macro, global, or callback (a
function-pointer typedef), keyed by its definition site — or, when the symbol
is never defined (a header typedef/decl), its canonical declaration.

Each `## <field>` section documents one record field; the heading name is the
field key.

## name

The C identifier exactly as written at the definition site. Composer-filled;
agents never edit it.

## kind

The symbol's category. Composer-filled -- the agent never edits
it. The enum is `function_{exported,static,inline_header,inline_tu}`, `macro`,
`global_{static,extern}`, `callback`.

### kind.callback

A callback is a function-pointer typedef (CodeQL identifies it
deterministically: a typedef whose unwrap chain reaches a RoutineType).
Composer-filled kind; signature-shaped (carries `ptr_args` / `ptr_ret` /
`used_by.{call,ref}` / a signature `depends_on`, NO body). `defined_in` is null (a
header typedef). The agent fills ONLY its per-arg/return ownership and its
`lifetime` role (same rules as functions -- an invoked `free_func` typedef IS a
dropper), inferring both from `used_by.call` (the invokers). When invokers
realize DIFFERENT contracts, the agent FORKS the callback: `--update` splits it
into multiple `kind:callback` entries, same name/type but distinct
`ptr_args`/`ptr_ret`/`lifetime`, disambiguated by a `variant` index (0 = primary,
composer-emitted; >=1 = agent-created fork) and a partitioned `used_by.call`. One
entry = one Rust wrapper. The `variant` field is absent/0 for the common
single-contract case.

## variant

Callback forks only, absent otherwise. A function-pointer typedef whose invokers
realize different ownership contracts is split into several records sharing a
`name`: the primary is variant 0 (implicit), each fork 1..N. A fork carries its
own `ptr_args` / `ptr_ret` / `lifetime`, and its `used_by.call` is the subset of
invokers realizing that contract -- the variants partition the invoker set.
Agent-created, through `forks` in a submission.

## _analysis

Derived at read time, never stored and never submitted.

- **`submitted`** -- whether the ownership store holds a record for this entity.
  A null slot cannot say this on its own: `lifetime: null` reads the same
  whether nobody has looked or an agent looked and found no lifecycle role.
- **`pending`** -- the pointer slots carrying no ownership block, as dotted
  paths. Under `--targeted-only` / `--imported-only` it counts only the fields that
  scope's code touches, so it agrees with what `--fields` shows.

`submitted: true` with a non-empty `pending` is a partial analysis.

## _comment_agent

Free-text note from the agent that analyzed the entity: the reasoning behind a
judgement, the evidence for it, and anything the structured slots cannot carry.
Agent-filled, absent until one is submitted.

## declared_in

Sorted list of header files that declare or export the symbol. Composer-filled.

## defined_in

The single file holding the definition: `.c` for functions and globals, `.h` for
inline functions and macros. Null when the symbol is declared in the DB but never
defined. Composer-filled.

## type

The full C signature for functions, the declared C type for globals, and null
for macros (a macro has no type). Composer-filled.

## is_variadic

`true` when the function takes a trailing `...` (a C variadic like `printf`),
`false` otherwise. Composer-filled from CodeQL (`Function.isVarargs()`) and
terminal. Present on function kinds; absent on macros, globals and
callbacks.

## loc

Body line span (`endLine-startLine+1`) of a function's definition; 1 for a
global, 0 for a macro; 0 when absent (a pre-loc extraction). Composer-filled from
`functions.csv`. Feeds the port bin-packer's lines-of-code batch budget
(`config.TRANSLATE_MAX_LOC`), which binds together with the symbol-count cap.

## ptr_args/ptr_ret

The two pointer records at a call boundary. `ptr_args` is a LIST -- one record
per pointer parameter, ordered by position (empty when the function has no
pointer params); `ptr_ret` is a single record, or null when the return type
isn't a pointer. Both carry the SAME fields, `position` / `name` for `ptr_args`.

COMPOSER fields (skeleton, always set), at the record's TOP level: on each
`ptr_args` record `position` and `name` (param name as written, falling back to
`arg<N>`); on both `ptr_args` and `ptr_ret` `type` (verbatim innermost pointee
type -- a user tag like `EVP_PKEY`, a primitive like `char`/`void`, or the
synthetic markers `(routine)`/`(array)`), `const` (is the innermost pointee
const-qualified?), and `depth` (1 for `T*`, 2 for `T**`, ...).

AGENT field -- each record carries a single `ptr` sub-object holding the
ownership block. It nests under `ptr` -- isolated from the
composer's top-level structural keys -- so `--update` replaces `ptr_args[i].ptr`
/ `ptr_ret.ptr` WHOLESALE, and a submitted block must be complete.

The composer emits `ptr: null`, so `null` means unanalyzed: whether a pointer
has been through a wrapper is a null check on one key. The keys of a
filled block:

- **`scalar`** -- Is there any execution path where this pointer references a
  SINGLE pointee? If not, `null`; otherwise `{by_val: true}` (points at one inline
  value -- the ordinary `T*`) | `{by_ref: {owned, borrowed}}` (points at one
  POINTER -- a `T**`, e.g. an out-param). Under `by_ref`, `owned`/`borrowed` is
  the INNER pointee's ownership (the top-level `owned`/`borrowed` then describes
  the OUTER slot -- for an out-param, borrowed); each is the same block as the
  top-level below. May co-exist with `array` and `string`.
- **`array`** -- Is there any execution path where this pointer references an array
  of elements? If not, `null`; otherwise `{by_val: true}` (buffer of inline
  values) | `{by_ref: {owned, borrowed}}` (buffer of element pointers -- a
  container). Under `by_ref`, `owned`/`borrowed` is the ELEMENT ownership, and
  may differ from the top-level `owned`/`borrowed` below - the elements and the container
  have their own ownership semantics. May co-exist with `scalar` and `string`.
  `scalar.by_ref` vs `array.by_ref` differ only in cardinality (one pointer vs a buffer of them).
- **`string`** -- Is there any execution path where this pointer is a NUL-terminated string?
  If yes, `true`; otherwise `false`. May co-exist with `scalar` and `array`.
- **`owned`** -- `true` if ownership TRANSFERRED across the call, `false`
  otherwise. On an arg the callee takes it, on the return the caller receives it.
- **`borrowed`** -- `null`, or `{lifetime}`: the pointer is borrowed, bound to
  another entity's lifetime. Sources are `arg:<name>`, `arg:<name>->path`,
  `static`, or `other` -- the arg-oriented vocabulary (a struct field instead
  borrows from `self` / a sibling field). Args are referenced BY NAME (the
  composer names every arg, real or synthetic `arg<pos>`); the positional
  `arg:<idx>` form is rejected. A transient read that doesn't outlive the call
  borrows from its OWN arg -- `arg:<its own name>`.
- **`nullable`** -- can this pointer be `NULL`? -> Rust `Option<...>`.
- **`mutable`** -- null/true/false: (i) `const=true` forces `false`; (ii)
  otherwise the agent decides by body inspection -- does the callee write through
  the pointer?; (iii) `null` ONLY when undeterminable (no definition available,
  e.g. an external symbol).
- **`note`** -- free-form; justify the above, highlight gaps and corner cases if any.

`owned` and `borrowed` MAY both be set -- runtime-conditional dual ownership
(owned on one path, borrowed on another); likewise, `array.by_ref.owned`+`.borrowed`.

**Invariants** (enforced on `--update`): a `ptr` block replaces the record's
prior block wholesale, so it must be complete -- `scalar` and `array` are each
null | exactly one of `{by_val, by_ref}`;
`string` and `owned` are explicit booleans (never null); a pointer sets at least
one of `{scalar, array, string}` (the floor); a pointer is either owned, or
borrowed, or both (never none) -- as is each `by_ref` element; a borrowed pointer
needs a lifetime, and an `arg:<name>` lifetime names a real arg BY NAME;
`const`-in-type implies `mutable != true`; `ptr_ret` only on a pointer-returning
symbol. `lifetime` inside a `ptr` block is rejected -- it is a symbol-level
field, see [`lifetime`](#lifetime).

## lifetime

Which lifecycle-primitive role THIS symbol plays, and on which of its args.
Agent-filled; `null` in the composer skeleton. Present on functions and
callbacks (the kinds with a call boundary); absent on globals and macros -- a
global's ownership has no acting method, and a macro has no args. The arg it
acts on is named in `for`.

- **`for`** -- the arg the role acts on, BY NAME, as a bare name (`s`, not
  `arg:s` and not a position). Must be one of this symbol's pointer args.
- **`is_dropper`** -- `true` if the symbol frees the arg's own STORAGE (i.e. the
  heap allocation): a full destructor. Requires the arg to be `owned`.
- **`is_disposer`** -- `true` if the symbol frees the storage of the arg's
  FIELDS but KEEPS the arg's own storage: a teardown / cleanup / reset that
  leaves the object reusable. Independent of `owned`/`borrowed` (a cleanup
  borrows the container).
- **`is_cloner`** -- `null`, or `{deep, upref}`: the symbol produces a copy of
  the arg. `deep` = a fresh allocation -> `Clone for CBox` on a type with no
  refcount, else a plain method (a refcounted type's `Clone` is its up_ref).
  `upref` = a refcount bump -> also `Clone for CBox`, via
  `impl_cloned!(N, c, up_ref = …)`.
  Both MAY be set: a body that branches between the two, or a `void *` whose
  concrete element decides at runtime. Requires the arg to be `borrowed` (it
  reads the source to copy it).

`is_dropper` and `is_disposer` are **mutually exclusive**: the arg's storage is
either released or retained, never both. A full destructor is `is_dropper` alone
-- it tears the fields down on the way, but its observable contract is that the
allocation is gone; a cleanup that resets the fields in place is `is_disposer`
alone.

**Invariants** (enforced on `--update`): `null` is both "not a lifecycle
primitive" and the unanalyzed state, and is always accepted; a non-null block
must assert at least one role (`is_dropper` | `is_disposer` |
`is_cloner.{deep,upref}`) -- otherwise submit `null`; `for` is required and
names a real pointer arg of this symbol, by bare name; `is_dropper` and
`is_disposer` are mutually exclusive booleans; `is_cloner.deep`/`.upref` are
explicit booleans (never null); `is_dropper` implies that arg is `owned`;
`is_cloner` implies that arg is `borrowed` -- both checked against the arg's
`ptr` as it stands AFTER the update, and skipped while that `ptr` is still
`null` (there is no ownership fact yet to contradict).

### How to disocver lifetime primitives

Unless otherwise stated, we are only interested in storage (i.e. heap allocation)
droppers/freers, field disposers (for user-defined types taken by-value, i.e.
embedded or on stack), and their cloners/duplicators. These will then be used
to implement `Drop` and `Clone` on its future Rust newtypes, allowing references
to this type to be owned / moved in Rust-native code.

Generally, we record a function as a lifetime primitive only if it has more than
one caller / referencer / consumer, or if it is publicly exposed; if it only lives to
serve as an internal routine with only callers that themselves are lifetime primitives,
then we can skip recording it. Query `wavefront` to obtain callers / referencers.

If your target type is:

  - The special keyword `void`, then look for lifetime primitives for raw,
  byte-level, untyped objects (`void *`). Look first for primitives from the
  standard library (`free`, `munmap`, `mmap`, `calloc`, `malloc`, `realloc`,
  `memcpy`, `memmove`, `strdup`, `strndup`, etc.). Then fetch the list of
  project-defined lifetime primitives by querying `wavefront` for methods
  calling the standard ones identified in the previous step. Continue looking up
  a few more hops up the callgraph to identify lifetime primitives that are
  specialized.  Filter to those taking `void` as argument to narrow the search
  space. Look for lifetime primitives that process both scalars and arrays.

  - The special keyword `string`, then look for lifetime primitives for
  NUL-terminated strings. You can fetch the list of lifetime candidates by
  querying `wavefront` for methods taking a `char *`/ `unsigned char *` /
  `u8 *`/`uint8_t *`/ etc. as an argument AND filtering for those calling one of
  the raw/void lifetime primitives identified by a previous run. Continue
  looking up a few more hops up the callgraph to identify more specialized
  primitives. Note that some of the void-tier primitives may also release
  / clone NUL-terminated strings, so they ought to be submitted too.

  - A `<type-tag>`, then look for lifetime primitives that for the given type
  tag.  You can fetch the list of lifetime candidates by querying
  `wavefront` for methods taking `<type-tag> *` as an argument AND filter
  for those that invoke one of the raw/void lifetime primitives identified in a
  previous run. Explore a few additional hops up the call graph to identify the
  real, top-level dropper(s)/field disposer(s) and cloner(s) of the type, which
  might call helpers that in turn call the raw/void lifetime primitives. If a
  type is a POD disposed through a field disposer of an embedding parent,
  process the parent disposer. Look for lifetime primitives that process both
  scalars and arrays. Submit your findings for the symbols schema, not for the
  types schema.

  After identifying your target set, proceed with and analyze them as described
  in the next sections.

## ptr / locked_by (globals)

A `global_*` entry has no call boundary, so it carries no `ptr_args`/`ptr_ret`.
Two agent-filled slots take their place (both `null` in the composer skeleton):

- **`ptr`** -- `null`, or the SAME ownership block a `ptr_args`/`ptr_ret` record
  nests under its `ptr` (`scalar`, `array`, `string`, `owned`, `borrowed`,
  `nullable`, `mutable`, `note`), for a global that stores a pointer (i.e. the
  pointee is allocated on the heap, or is another global).  Here the
  entry's `ptr` IS that block directly (a global has no `position`/`type`/`const`
  to un-mix, since those live at the entry level), so it too is replaced
  wholesale. `null` for a non-pointer global (a scalar or a by-value struct).
- **`locked_by`** -- `null`, or `{lock, lock_op, unlock_op}`: the concurrency
  binding on ANY global (pointer or not) accessed under a lock.
  - **`lock`** -- name of the lock object (a global or field) that guards the slot.
  - **`lock_op`** -- the LIST of acquire routines (e.g.
    `["CRYPTO_THREAD_read_lock", "CRYPTO_THREAD_write_lock"]`); which ops appear
    captures the read-vs-write discipline.
  - **`unlock_op`** -- the LIST of release routines (e.g. `["CRYPTO_THREAD_unlock"]`).

  `locked_by` sits at the entry level (a sibling of `ptr`), NOT inside `ptr`,
  because the guarded datum is often a non-pointer (a refcount `int`, a flag).
  The struct-field form of the same binding lives on the field record (see
  [types.md](types.md)).

## used_by

Composer-filled (agents must not modify). `call` and `ref`
name the enclosing functions (or file paths for file-scope macro expansions) that
reach this entry. By kind: `function_*` -> `{call:[callers], ref:[addr-of users]}`,
where a site that both calls and takes the address is listed only under `call`;
`global_*` -> `{call:null, ref:[accessors]}`; `macro_*` -> `{call:[expansion
sites], ref:[]}`. The composer's default bucketing is fine for most kinds; the
a wrapper may re-bucket `call`<->`ref` when a macro kind justifies it.

## depends_on

Composer ground-truth (agents must not modify).
`depends_on.syms` is the forward callee/reference set: each record is `{name,
defined_in, declared_in}`, with `defined_in` nullable for externals (e.g. libc
functions not in the DB) -- resolve via `defined_in` first, else
`declared_in[0]`. `depends_on.types` is the forward type-use list: each record is
`{type, fields}`, where `type` is the canonical struct/union/enum tag (typedef
chains resolved) and `fields` are the accessed field names. The composer unions
signature types (parameters/return) with body-touched types from
`t2/field_accesses.csv`; signature types come first (signature order), body-only
types follow (first-encounter order); a signature type whose body touches no
field carries `fields:[]` (opaque use).
